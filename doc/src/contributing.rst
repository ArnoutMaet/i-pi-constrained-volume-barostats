i-PI is an open source project, and everyone is welcome to contribute
with bug fixes, documentation, examples, new features, regression tests, etc.

Your contribution should be based on the master branch. We kindly ask you to first fork the project,
make your changes, make sure you comply with all items in our checklist below, and finally create a pull request (PR).

Checklist to create a pull request:

- The PR follows our format compliance (based on `black` and `flake8` as explained above)
- All the new classes and functions include the corresponding docstrings

(If the PR adds a new functionally, please fulfill the next two requirements as well)

- Add a working example to the `examples` folder to showcase the new functionality
- Add a regression test to the `i-pi/ipi_tests/regression_tests` folder (see the corresponding README file for further details)
- Make sure that all the automatic checks pass without any error

We are looking forward to your contribution!
