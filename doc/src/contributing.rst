DRAFT!

i-PI is an open source project, and everyone is welcome to contribute

Your contribution should be based on the master branch. We kindly ask you to first fork the project,

Checklist to create a pull request:

(If the PR adds a new functionally, please fulfill the next two requirements as well)

- Add a working example to the `examples` folder to showcase the new functionality
