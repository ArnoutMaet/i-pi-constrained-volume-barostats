See documentaion of how to run the regression tests by running:

   "python test_run.py -h"

To add a new regression test please provide:

   - input.xml (and all the files required by it)

   - driver.txt specifing  "<driver> <address> <port> <unix/inet> " (see existing examples)

   - a reference output with the name 'ref_simulation.out'

Important: 

   The extension *.out appears in the .gitignore  file
   This means that the 'ref_simulation.out' file has to be added manually to your commit.
   You can do that by typing:

    "git add -f ref_simulation.out"
