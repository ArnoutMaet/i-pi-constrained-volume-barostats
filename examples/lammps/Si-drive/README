This is an example for a time dependent drive in the smotion class involving a solid.

Order of manipulations to get things done:
  1. Make sure you have i-PI and LAMMPS installed,
     put proper executable names to run-*.sh

  2. Calculate phonons with i-PI (or with your code of choice)

  3. Convert i-PI normal modes to xyz_jmol format using 'eigvec-to-xyz_jmol.py'
     (call it without parameters to see the options and ask for script if you don't have it)
     If you created phonons with another code, feel free to convert them.

  4. Using these eigenvectors, make coupling constants by 'make-couplings-dmd.py'
     The constants are produced for all modes at the same time.
     NOTE that the first number in each line is a frequency, then the constants follow.
     (Ask us for script if you don't have it)

  5. Pick one line of constants or make some linear combination, and put them to a file 'coupling.dat'
     i-PI expects only constants as a single line in this file, 
     therefore you have to remove a frequency before putting a line in 'coupling.dat'

  6. Adjust driving frequency in input-dmd.xml

  7. run i-PI with the driving frequency!
